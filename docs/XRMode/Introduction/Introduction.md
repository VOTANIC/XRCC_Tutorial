# Introduction

Being a content creator dedicated to creating XR experiences, although it is possible to run and test the created project in the XRCC PC, the experience is most complete when it is run in XR where you interact with the virtual world spatially in three-dimensional space. The XRCC XR is the entry point to experiencing the project created in XRCC across different XR systems.

The XRCC XR runs on a variety of XR systems such as the immersive CAVE system, multi-display system, and a range of head-mounted display (HMD) systems in both local and multiplayer sessions. It allows you to play and edit the projects created in the XRCC PC, or create new projects in XR using the built-in pre-packaged assets.
