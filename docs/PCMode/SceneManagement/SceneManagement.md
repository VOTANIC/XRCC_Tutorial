# Scene Management

A scene is the user-defined collection of items and behaviours, it is visualized in the Scene View of the XRCC PC. When a new project is created, one scene is created automatically using the Start Scene selected for the project. Further scene management features are available in the XRCC PC to perform more advanced scene-related operations.
