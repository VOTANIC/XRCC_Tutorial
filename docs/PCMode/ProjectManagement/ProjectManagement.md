# Project Management

This section introduces various project management features of the XRCC PC. A project file is required for editing and playback of the XRCC project. A XRCC project file carries a file extension of "**.ccdata**" (e.g. "***project_name.ccdata***"), the default save folder for Local XRCC project files is located at **XRCC** > **Resources** > **Saves**, but you can also change the XRCC Local Save location in the [Settings Panel](/PCMode/Misc/Settings). However, the default save folder for Network XRCC project files is located at **AppData** > **LocalLow** > **Votanic** > **XRCC (Server)** > **Server** > **Projects**
