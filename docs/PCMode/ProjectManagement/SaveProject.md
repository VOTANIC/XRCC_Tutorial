To save the project, select "**File** -> **Save Project**" (**Ctrl + S**) on the Main Menu, or press the save button at the top-right corner to save the changes to your current project file.

If you attempt to **close** the current project or **close** XRCC with any unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save or **discard** the changes before closing the project.
