# Assets Management

Assets are resources useful in constructing the scenes in a project. In XRCC, assets exist in two different forms: the pre-packaged assets that can be shared among different projects, and the project-specific assets imported and managed by the user.

Assets are identified by their asset type and are used in different ways in the scene. The default asset types in XRCC are:

|Model|Image|Audio|Video|Document|Motion|Character|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Model.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Image.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Audio.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Video.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Document.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Motion.png)|![](/img/AssetManagement/Icon/Character.png)|
