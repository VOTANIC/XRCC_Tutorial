# Multi-User Networked Editing

The Multi-User Networked Editing feature enables collaborative editing of a project with multiple participants. Within this function, you can modify the status of an object, including its behaviour together with other users. However, to optimize the multi-user collaboration experience, features requiring high network bandwidth (as as importing new assets) is turned off in networked mode.
