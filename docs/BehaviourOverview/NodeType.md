# Node Type

This section provide an overview of the various node types used by behaviour blocks, including their definition and usage.

## Vector3
A three-dimensional vector representing a point or direction in 3D space. It consists of three components: X, Y, and Z coordinates. Vector3 is commonly used for positions, directions, and scaling in 3D environments.

## Boolean
A logical data type that can have one of two possible values: true or false. Booleans are often used in conditional statements, toggle switches, or to represent the state of certain properties.

## Number
A numeric value that can be either a whole number or a decimal number.

## Integer
A whole number without any fractional part.

## Color
A Color value specifying a color in the XRCC environment. Color is used to define and manipulate colors for various visual elements in the scene. It typically consists of red, green, blue, and sometimes alpha (transparency) components.

- Red: The intensity of red in the color.
- Green: The intensity of green in the color.
- Blue: The intensity of blue in the color.
- Alpha: The transparency of the color.

## Text
A string of characters that can be used to display text in the XRCC environment. Text is used for various purposes in the XRCC environment, such as labels, buttons, or other UI elements. It can be in various formats like text, font, and color.

## Object
A reference to an entity in the XRCC environment. Objects can represent various elements in a scene, such as 3D models, UI elements, or other interactive components. They can have properties, behaviors, and can be manipulated or interacted with during runtime.

### Focus Point
A specific point on a Model/Character object, commonly found on Character object and use for targeting the character's hand or foot point.

## Scene
A reference to a existing scene, existing scene can be found in [Scene Menu](/PCMode/SceneManagement/SceneMenu)

## Asset
A media asset stored in the project, existing asset can be found in [Asset Panel](/PCMode/AssetsManagement/AssetManagementPanel).

## Action
A reference to a specific behaviour action node, refer to [Create Re-usable Behaviour using Action](/PCMode/BehaviourManagement/CreateReusableBehaviourUsingAction) for more detail.
