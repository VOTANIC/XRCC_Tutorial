XRCC PC offers a block-based graphical user interface with a large library of built-in operators, control 
flows, events, and actions, that allow you to put together the flow of the behaviours in a visual manner, 
without needing to write a line of code.

Below is a list of behaviour block categories accessible by all object
types:

  |Icon | Description|
