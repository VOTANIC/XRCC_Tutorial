## Planning for Your Content Creation

Before diving into creating the XR experience in XRCC, it's preferred
that you spend some time planning for the content creation. The planning
and preparation process would be invaluable to the actual content
creation, as it helps you to straight out the flow of the XR experience
from a macroscopic view, and get ready all the necessary materials for
creation in XRCC.

### Conception

We start with developing a concept for the XR experience. The conception
process can help you gain a good understanding of how you will create
the XR experience and identify the essential elements needed for the
content creation process.

For developing the concept of the XR experience, you may consider the
following aspects of the content to plan for the production:

-   What is the XR experience about?

    -   Training / education experience

    -   Presenting information / design showcase

    -   Virtual tour

    -   Interactive serious game

-   What is the goal and objective?

    -   Acquire / share knowledge

    -   Develop hands-on skills

    -   Relaxation

-   How would user be guided to walk through the XR experience?

    -   Virtual environment

    -   Object placement

    -   Scene structure of XR experience

    -   User movement

-   What are the assets needed for the content creation?

    -   3D models

    -   Videos, images

    -   Audio / sound effects

### Prepping the Assets

Once you laid out the specifics of the XR experience, the next step is
to gather all the assets for the project. Although XRCC has a few
built-in assets available by default, it is probably not enough to meet
the requirements of your unique XR experience. In this stage, you can
try gather all the necessary assets yourself or from various online
resources.

#### XRCC Asset Formats and Specifications

Assets are resources useful in constructing the scenes in a project. In
XRCC, assets exist in two different forms: the pre-packaged assets that
can be shared among different projects, and the project-specific assets
imported and managed by the user.

Assets are identified by their asset type and are used in different ways
in the scene. The default asset types in XRCC are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Asset Type</th>
            <th>File Extension</th>
            <th>Recommended Specification</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><center>3D Model</center></td>
            <td>.fbx, .obj, .ply, .stl, .gltf, .glb, .3mf</td>
            <td>.fbx or .gltf / .glb format, maximum texture size of 2048x2048, file size not exceeding 100 MB, less than 30k triangles per model, with 1 embedded animation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Image</center></td>
            <td>.bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png</td>
            <td>2D image size: 1920x1080, 360 image size: 4096x2048</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Audio</center></td>
            <td>.mp3, .wav</td>
            <td>mp3 format minimal 1 second length, 44,100 Hz and 128 Kbps</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Video</center></td>
            <td>.mp4</td>
            <td>2D video size: 1920x1080, 360 video size: 4096x2048, file size not exceeding 100 MB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Document</center></td>
            <td>.pdf</td>
            <td>file size not exceeding 100 MB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

:::note
360-degrees images/ videos of Equirectangular monoscopic
projection type are supported
:::

#### Readying the 3D Models

You can prepare the 3D models by either creating them yourself or by
leveraging content created by others from online resources.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th style={{width:'70%'}}>Tools/Resources</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Create 3D model yourself</center></td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Online 3D model resources</center></td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://sketchfab.com/">SketchFab</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/">CGTrader</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/">Turbo Squid</a></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><center>Generative AI 3D model creation tools</center></td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.meshy.ai/">Meshy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://lumalabs.ai/">Luma AI</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.alpha3d.io/ai-3d-model-generator/">Alpha3D</a></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
 
Although XRCC supports multiple 3D model formats, we recommend using the
fbx or gltf/glb formats for best compatibility.

:::tip
The file size and number of 3D models will significantly impact the loading time of the XRCC projects. We recommend that you keep the number of 3D models imported into your project to below 30 for an acceptable project loading experience.
:::

#### Getting 360 Contents

Like 3D models, you can also create your own 360 degree contents
yourself or from online resources.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Create 360 contents yourself</td>
            <td>Using a *360 degree camera* to capture and export from the complimentary editing software</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Online resources</td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/">Equirectangular Group on Flickr</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.freepik.com/search?format=search&last_filter=selection&last_value=1&query=360&selection=1&type=photo">Freepik</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=360">YouTube</a></li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Content Production in XRCC

### XRCC Workspace

The Workspace is the default user interface in the XRCC PC where you
work to create the XR content. The Workspace is organized using
different tabs, each provide a set of tools for users to access
different features of the XRCC.

![](/img/Tutorial/Fundamentals/image3.png)

| **Section** | **Name** |
|:-------:|:-------------------:|
| *1*     | Main Workspace      |
| *2*     | Project Header      |
| *3*     | Main Menu           |
| *4*     | Status bar          |
| *5*     | Window Control      |

### General Control

The Scene View is accessible under the **Edit** tab; it visualizes the
Scene in 3D space. While in **Edit Mode**, the Scene View allows you to
navigate and edit the scene, and interact with different objects in the
scene. While in **Play Mode**, the Scene View simulates the final visual
representation of the created XR scene in first-person perspective,
where you can test out the interactions designed for the scene.Â 

#### Edit Mode

To navigate the user's view in **Edit Mode**, different navigation tools
can be used.

##### Mouse Control

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>

corresponding special object.
:::

#### Object Selection

To select an object, use a transform tool (move / rotate / scale /
offset) to point and left-click on the object in the scene. Any objects
that can be selected will have a green overlay when the mouse cursor
hovers over it. Click on any region in the scene with no object to
cancel the selection. The selected object will have a green outline
around it.

  | Selectable Object (green overlay) | Selected Object (green outline) |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | ![A green cube with a cursor Description automatically generated](/img/Tutorial/Fundamentals/image27.png) | ![A white cube with a green border Description automatically generated](/img/Tutorial/Fundamentals/image28.png) |

To quickly focus on the selected object, simply press the shortcut key
\'**F**\' on your keyboard.

#### Object Transform 

When an object is selected, a gizmo will appear for you to control the

#### Inspector

Press "**Inspector**"
(<InspectorIcon className="XRCCIcon"/>)
(**I**) to toggle the Inspector Panel. The panel displays the
detail of the selected object and allows you to modify various object
properties. Some special objects have more unique settings that can only
be assessed through the panel.

If you deselect all objects in scene, the Inspector will allow you
to configure the Scene Setting.

### Add Interactivity

You can create and view behaviour by first select an object in the Scene
View, then switch to the Behaviour tab to add or view behaviour for the
selected object.

:::note
if you access the Behavior tab without selecting any objects, you
can define or view behaviors for the current scene.

#### Building New Behaviour

To create a behaviour, simply drag the behaviour blocks you need to the
Behaviour Graph Panel and connect the blocks. Drag-and-release from the
output node to the input node of the destined block to form a line.

You will need to use an "**Event**" type block to kickstart any
behaviour. We consider it one behaviour when different behaviour blocks
are joined together by connection wires, which form a complete execution
chain. More than one behaviour can co-exist for an item, and they can
execute independently or even use the same event to start the behaviour.
