## Edit Mode

XRCC provides the features to create, edit, and debug their project in an XR environment. By creating/loading a project file, the user can manage the scenes and objects in the scene.

<mark>*Note that editing of object behaviour is not available in XR, please use PC mode instead to edit behaviour and refer to the XRCC PC user guide for details.*</mark>
