# Introduction

Being a content creator dedicated to creating XR experiences, althoughit is possible to run and test the created project in the XRCC PC, theexperience is most complete when it is run in XR where you interact withthe virtual world spatially in three-dimensional space. The XRCC XR isthe entry point to experiencing the project created in XRCC acrossdifferent XR systems.

The XRCC XR runs on a variety of XR systems such as the immersive CAVEsystem, multi-display system, and a range of head-mounted display (HMD)systems in both local and multiplayer sessions. It allows you to playand edit the projects created in the XRCC PC, or create new projects inXR using the built-in pre-packaged assets.
