The XRCC PC provides a few pre-configured scenes for use as a starting point of your project. Pick one of the **Start Scene** to kickstart your project or select the "**Empty Scene**" if you prefer to build everything yourself from scratch. The Start Scene will be the scene that loads by default when the project is loaded.

Select the start scene you want by pressing "**Thumbnail**" or clicking the checkbox.

For project creation, a "**.ccdata**" file will be generated at the designated save location.

After the project is created, it will load the start scene automatically into the Workspace, and you can start building the project in the XRCC PC now.
