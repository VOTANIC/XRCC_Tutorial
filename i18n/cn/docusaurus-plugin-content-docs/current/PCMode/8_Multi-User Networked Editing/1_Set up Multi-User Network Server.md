## Set up Multi-User Network Server {#set-up-multi-user-network-server .unnumbered}

Running a server for multi-user networked editing is essential due to its central role in managing and synchronizing project data across all users. It enables real-time collaboration, ensuring that changes made by one user are instantly available to others. Additionally, the server provides robust access control and security measures to protect the project\'s integrity. By hosting project data and resources centrally, it ensures consistent access for all team members, regardless of their location.

<mark>*Note: For setting up the server remotely and if pack is used, you will need to ensure the server\'s resources folder also contains the respective asset pack for running the project.*</mark>
