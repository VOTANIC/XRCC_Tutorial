# Project Management

This section introduces various project management features of the XRCC PC. A project file is required for editing and playback of the XRCC project. A XRCC project file carries a file extension of "**.ccdata**" (e.g. "***project_name.ccdata***"), the default save folder for XRCC project files is located at **XRCC** > **Resources** > **Saves**, but you can also change the XRCC Local Save location in the **Settings Panel**.
